To make substantive contributions to these specifications, you must either participate in the relevant W3C Working Group or make a non-member patent licensing commitment.

Some documents are still incubated in the Community Group, and are governed by the [W3C Community License Agreement (CLA)](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/).

To make substantive contributions, you must join the CG. 

If you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all 
contributors in the pull request comment.

To add a contributor (other than yourself, that's automatic), mark them one per line as follows:

If you added a contributor by mistake, you can remove them in a comment with:

```

```

If you are making a pull request on behalf of someone else but you had no part in designing the 
feature, you can remove yourself with the above syntax.
