        The MiniApps Ecosystem Community Group provides a forum for global community to discuss, incubate, and propose MiniApp related standard ideas with the goal to bring more interoperability and robustness to MiniApp ecosystem.
    </p>
    <h2 id="background">
      Background
    </h2>
    <p>MiniApp as a new form of mobile application, leveraging both Web technologies (especially CSS and JavaScript) as well as capabilities of native applications, is gaining more and more popularities in Asian countries such as China. To enhance the interoperability between different MiniApp platforms (AKA the super application or host application), main stream MiniApp vendors has been working together in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/chinese-web-ig/">W3C Chinese Web Interest Group</a> since May 2019 and published a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mini-app-white-paper/">MiniApp Standardization White Paper</a> in September 2019 as the initial standardization exploration for MiniApp technologies.</p>

    <p>As more global companies get interested in joining the MiniApp related discussion, the MiniApp Ecosystem Community Group was proposed and approved during TPAC 2019 so that global Web community can join the discussion.</p>
    <h2 id="scope">
      Scope of Work
    </h2>
    <p>The MiniApp Ecosystem Community Group aims to discuss proposals for MiniApp features that would benefit the interoperability and robustness of MiniApp ecosystem, including:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Basic architecture and essential functions of MiniApp such as the URI scheme, widget, application lifecycle and event, as well as Manifest;
    <li>Elements and APIs that would enhance the interoperability among different MiniApp platforms, including UI elements, Device API, and those advanced APIs such as Account API and Map API;
    <li>Coordination with current W3C efforts, especially PWA, on the commonality of Web features;
    <li>Carry out horizontal review for accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security for MiniApp specifications;
</ol>
    <h2 id="nonscope">
      Out of Scope
    </h2>
    <p>
        The group does not intend to discuss ideas related to MiniApp platform operation.
    </p>
    <h2 id="proposals">
      Current Proposals
    </h2>
    <p>Based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mini-app-white-paper/">MiniApp Standardization White Paper</a> as well as previous discussion in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/chinese-web-ig/">W3C Chinese Web Interest Group</a>, the following projects are proposed as initial standardization exploration of MiniApp.</p>

<ul>
<li>URI scheme
<li>Widget
<li>Application life cycle and events
<li>Manifest
</ul>

<p>New projects or status changes are communicated to the group through the public mailing list. Chairs and editors should publish status updates to the group public mailing list to allow group participants to monitor progress without having to directly watch every repo.</p>
    <h2 id="coordination">
        Coordination
    </h2>
    <p>
        It is anticipated that the group will collaborate with appropriate W3C Working Groups and WHATWG work streams in order to transition spec proposals to the Recommendation or Living Standard track. This group will probably get into collaboration with the following groups:
    </p>
    <ul>
            <li>Web Application Working Group</li>
            <li>Web Performance Working Group</li>
            <li>Service Workers Working Group</li>
            <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group</li>
            <li>Devices and Sensors Working Group</li>
            <li>Web Application Security Working Group</li>
            <li>Immersive Web Working Group</li>
            <li>Web Incubator Community Group (WICG)</li>
            <li>Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group</li>
            <li>Machine Learning Community Group</li>
            <li>Internationalization Working Group</li>
            <li>Privacy Interest Group (PING)</li>
            <li>WHATWG </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="process">
      Community and Business Group Process and Patent Policy
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group operates under the <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/">Community and Business
      Group Process</a>. Terms of in this charter that conflict with those of
      the Community and Business Group Process are void.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with other Community Groups, W3C seeks organizational licensing
      commitments under the <a href=
      'http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/'>W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a> (Proposals in this Community
      Group charter are applicable "Specification" in the CLA). When people
      request to participate without representing their organization’s legal
      interests, W3C will in general approve those requests for this group with
      the following understanding: W3C will seek and expect an organizational
      commitment under the CLA starting with the individual’s first request to
      make a contribution to a group deliverable. The section on <a href=
      "#contrib">Contribution Mechanics</a> describes how W3C expects to
      monitor these contribution requests.
    </p>
    <h2 id="communication">
        Communication
    </h2>
    <p>
        The group tends to have monthly teleconferences and conducts its work on the public mailing list <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-miniapps/">public-miniapps@w3.org</a> as well as its <a href="https://github.com/w3c/miniapp">GitHub repository</a> for technical discussions. Other communication tools are allowed if considerable number of the group participants decide to embrace them.
    </p>
    <h2 id="participation-and-contribution">
        Participation and Contribution
    </h2>
    <p>Membership of the group is open to everybody but all participants will have signed the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/">W3C Community Contributor License Agreement</a>. Chairs and editors of feature proposals must ensure that no contributions are adopted from anyone who is not a member of the Community Group.</p>

    <p>Specifications created for proposals in the Community Group must use the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-document">W3C Software and Document License</a>.</p>

    <p>All Github repositories attached to the Community Group must contain a copy of the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/licenses/blob/master/CG-CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING</a> and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/licenses/blob/master/CG-LICENSE.md">LICENSE</a> files.</p>

    <p>Note: this CG will not use a <em>contrib</em> mailing list for contributions since all contributions will be tracked via Github mechanisms (e.g. pull requests).</p>
    <h2 id="decision">
        Decision Policy
    </h2>
    <p>This group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus. Consensus will be recorded through meeting minutes or its GitHub repo issue list with assistance from the Chairs.</p>

    <p>Any technical specification that is planned to be proposed to a W3C Working Group should require:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>2 MiniApp vendors who have intention to implement the proposed specification(s)
    <li>Reasonable support from MiniApp developers
    </ul>
