        </h2>
        <p>MiniApp as a new form of mobile application, leveraging both Web technologies (especially CSS and JavaScript) as well as capabilities of native applications, is gaining more and more popularities in Asian countries such as China. To enhance the interoperability between different MiniApp platforms (AKA the super application or host application), main stream MiniApp vendors has been working together in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/chinese-web-ig/">W3C Chinese Web Interest Group</a> since May 2019 and published a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mini-app-white-paper/">MiniApp Standardization White Paper</a> in September 2019 as the initial standardization exploration for MiniApp technologies. As more global companies get interested in joining the MiniApp related discussion, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/miniapps/">MiniApps Ecosystem Community Group</a> was proposed and approved during TPAC 2019 so that global Web community can join the discussion.</p>

    <p>The MiniApps Working Group aims to work on specifications incubated in the MiniApps Ecosystem Community Group for MiniApp features that would benefit the interoperability and robustness of MiniApp ecosystem, including:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Basic architecture and essential functions of MiniApp such as the URI scheme, widget, application lifecycle and event, manifest, and packaging;
    <li>Components, APIs, and a template mechanism that would enhance the interoperability among different MiniApp platforms, such as UI components, Device APIs, Account API etc.;
    <li>Coordination with other W3C efforts, especially Progressive Web Apps, on the commonality of Web features.

          To advance to Proposed Recommendation, each specification must have
          two independent implementations of all defined features.
        </p>
        <p>
          Comprehensive test suites will be developed for each specification to
          ensure interoperability, and the group will create interoperability
          reports. The group will also maintain errata as required for the
          continued relevance and usefulness of the specifications it produces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each specification must contain a section on accessibility that
          describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification
          features can be used to address them, and recommendations for
          maximising accessibility in implementations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each specification must detail all known security and privacy
          implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.
        </p>
        <p>

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more
          active participants for its duration, and to have the participation
          of the industry leaders in fields relevant to the specifications it
          produces.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Chair(s) and specification Editors are expected to contribute one
          to two days per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum
          requirement for other participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the input from the group participants, the Chairs may also
          decide to create task forces that allow more focused discussions for
          topics that require specific expertise.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Working Group will also allocate the necessary resources for
          building Test Suites for each specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions and comments on its public mailing
          lists and document repositories, as described in <a href=
          "#communication">Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical
          submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of
          the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent
          Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participants in the group are required (by the <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C
          Process</a>) to follow the W3C <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional
          Conduct</a>.

          Communication
        </h2>
        <p>
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">
          public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face
          meetings will be archived for public review, and technical
          discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can
          be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and
          Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public
          repository, and may permit direct public contribution requests. The
          meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (for example, details about deliverables,
          issues, actions, status, participants) is available from the <a href=
          "#">MiniApps Working Group home page</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Working Group’s Teleconferences focus on discussion of particular
          specifications, and are conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work on the <a href= "https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-miniapps-wg/">public-miniapps-wg@w3.org</a> and on GitHub issues. Other communication tools are allowed if considerable number of the group participants decide to embrace them. The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group uses a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative
          purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and participants of the
          group, for Member-only discussions in special cases when a particular
          participant requests such a discussion.

      <div class="decisions">
        <h2 id="decisions">
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due
          process, per the <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process
          Document (section 3.3)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant
          makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with
          members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with
          little formal voting being required.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but
          consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of
          views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a
          decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any
          resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face
          meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for
          consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via
          email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from 5 to 10
          working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group
          consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised on the mailing
          list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be
          considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless
          and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at
          the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href=

          Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures
          beyond what the Process Document requires.
