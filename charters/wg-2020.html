          Mission
        </h2>
        <p>
          MiniApp as a new form of mobile application, leveraging both Web technologies (especially CSS and JavaScript) as well as capabilities of native applications, is gaining more and more popularity in the globe. To enhance the interoperability between MiniApp platforms and the Web, and between different MiniApp platforms (applications or operating systems that are hosts to MiniApps), mainstream MiniApp vendors and related stakeholders have been working together in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/chinese-web-ig/">W3C Chinese Web Interest Group</a> since May 2019 and published a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mini-app-white-paper/">MiniApp Standardization White Paper</a> in September 2019 as the initial standardization exploration for MiniApp technologies. As more global companies get interested in joining the MiniApp related discussion, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/miniapps/">MiniApps Ecosystem Community Group</a> was proposed and approved during TPAC 2019 so that the global Web community can join the discussion.</p>

        <p>
          During the exploration phase, potential standard requirements have been identified due to the unique nature of MiniApp in comparison to the typical Web environment. Substantial research work and joint discussion with related W3C groups have been conducted to clarify the requirements and possible solutions for MiniApp standardization. For instance, the hosting platform may or may not be a browser, and the application construction may or may not be based on web resources. Therefore different but relevant technologies are used for UI configuration and rendering, resource packaging, and the API access to local system capabilities. Such cases have not been fully covered by existing Web standards such as <a href="https://github.com/WICG/webpackage">Web Packaging</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/">Web App Manifest</a>, or Web APIs.
        </p>        
        <p>The MiniApps Working Group aims to harmonize the heterogeneous MiniApp ecosystem, enabling interoperability among the different MiniApp platforms, maximizing the convergence of MiniApps and the World Wide Web, reducing the development costs and facilitating the adoption of this technology.</p>

      <div class="scope">

          Scope
        </h2>
    <p>The work will be based on the specifications incubated in the MiniApps Ecosystem Community Group for MiniApp features, which include the following:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Basic architecture and essential functions of MiniApp such as the Manifest, Packaging, Addressing, and Lifecycle, as indicated in the <a href="#deliverables">Deliverables</a> section; 
    <li>MiniApp UI components (encapsulated reusable code for rendering a part of the UI), component-associated APIs, and a page layout template mechanism that would enhance the interoperability among different MiniApp platforms and the Web. Other components and APIs may be included by rechartering the WG scope as the incubation result from the MiniApp Community Group.
    <li>Coordination with other W3C efforts, especially security, privacy, accessibility, internationalization and other Webapp APIs including Progressive Web Apps, on the commonality of the Web.
</ol>

              This specification defines a JSON-based manifest document that enables developers to set up descriptive information, window styling, page routing, feature policies, and other information of a MiniApp. The MiniApp Manifest specification will follow the recommendations of the <a href="https://w3ctag.github.io/design-principles/#extend-manifests">Web Platform Design Principles</a> to extend the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/">Web App Manifest</a>.

MiniApp application lifecycle includes a set of events, including application initialization, application running in foreground, application running in background. MiniApp page lifecycle includes a set of events, including page loading, page first rendering ready, page running in foreground, page running in background and page unloading. Whenever possible, the specification should provide a mapping to existing Web specifications such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers/">Service Workers</a> and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/page-visibility/">Page Visibility</a>.

          encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review
          groups throughout development of each specification. The Working
          Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first
          entering <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR"
          title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged to
          proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes
          occur in a specification following a review.

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more
          active participants for its duration, and to have the participation
          of the industry leaders in fields relevant to the specifications it
          produces.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Chair(s) and specification Editors are expected to contribute one
          to two days per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum
          requirement for other participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the input from the group participants, the Chairs may also
          decide to create task forces that allow more focused discussions for
          topics that require specific expertise.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Working Group will also allocate the necessary resources for
          building Test Suites for each specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions and comments on its public mailing
          lists and document repositories, as described in <a href=
          "#communication">Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical
          submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of
          the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent
          Policy</a>.

          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">
          public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face
          meetings will be archived for public review, and technical
          discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can
          be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and
          Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public
          repository, and may permit direct public contribution requests. The
          meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (for example, details about deliverables,
          issues, actions, status, participants) is available from the <a href=

        </p>
        <p>
          The Working Group’s Teleconferences focus on discussion of particular
          specifications, and are conducted on an as-needed basis. The minimum time
          required for notice of an ad-hoc teleconference should be 3 working days.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work on the <a href= "https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-miniapps-wg/">public-miniapps-wg@w3.org</a> and on <a href="#TBD">GitHub issues</a>. Other communication tools are allowed if 80% of the group participants decide to embrace them. Any decision to use other communication tools must be reevaluated if further W3C Members join the Working Group. The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group uses a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative
          purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and participants of the
          group, for Member-only discussions in special cases when a particular
          participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2 id="decisions">
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due
          process, per the <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process
          Document (section 3.3)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant
          makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with
          members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with
          little formal voting being required.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but
          consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of
          views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a
          decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any
          resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face
          meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for
          consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via
          email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from 5 to 10
          working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group
          consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised on the mailing
          list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be
          considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless
          and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at
          the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
